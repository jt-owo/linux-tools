## Vesktop Theme

To auto apply the Vesktop Theme with the setup you might have to change the theme directory var in the `setup.sh` file. (You can simply fork the repo)
`vesktop_theme_dir=~/.config/vesktop/themes/`

You also have to update the theme name variable.
`vesktop_theme_name=ClearVision_v6.theme.css`
